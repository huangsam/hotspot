-- Version 1: Initial schema
-- Note: Tables are created by the application code in analysis_store.go
-- This migration establishes a baseline version for existing databases.
-- Future migrations will contain actual schema changes and should be applied in order.
-- No action is needed for version 1, as tables are created on first use by the application.
