# examples/hotspot.weights.yml
#
# Example configuration showing how to customize scoring weights.
# This demonstrates overriding the default "hot" mode weights to emphasize
# different aspects of code analysis.

# --- Global Settings ---
limit: 20
mode: hot

# --- Custom Scoring Weights ---
# Each mode can have custom weights that override the defaults.
# Weights must sum to 1.0 (or 100%) for each mode.
# Available weight components vary by mode:
# - hot: age, churn, commits, contrib, size
# - risk: age, churn, commits, gini, inv_contrib, loc, size
# - complexity: age, churn, commits, loc, low_recent, size
# - stale: age, commits, contrib, inv_recent, size

weights:
  hot:
    # Emphasize recent activity over file size
    age: 0.05      # Reduced from default 0.10
    churn: 0.50    # Increased from default 0.40
    commits: 0.40  # Same as default
    contrib: 0.03  # Reduced from default 0.05
    size: 0.02     # Reduced from default 0.05

  risk:
    # Focus more on contributor concentration
    age: 0.10
    churn: 0.05
    commits: 0.03
    gini: 0.35      # Increased from default 0.26
    inv_contrib: 0.35  # Increased from default 0.30
    loc: 0.05
    size: 0.07

  complexity:
    # Prioritize technical debt indicators
    age: 0.40      # Increased from default 0.30
    churn: 0.25    # Reduced from default 0.30
    commits: 0.05
    loc: 0.20
    low_recent: 0.05
    size: 0.05

  stale:
    # Emphasize lack of recent activity
    age: 0.15
    commits: 0.10
    contrib: 0.03
    inv_recent: 0.50  # Increased from default 0.35
